All servers should have their configuration saved into version control
somewhere. Many people use Puppet or Chef to manage their configuration.
That is a little more power than I need for a few home servers, so I use
git. I'm very familiar with it, and it works great. If I make a change
and it breaks something, I can just rollback the changes to a known
working state. This article outlines a basic way to host your
configuration files on BitBucket, which provides unlimited free, private
repositories. You could also host them on your own server, but this was
much easier for me. I create one repository per server (or set of
servers).

To follow this article, [please sign up for a BitBucket
account](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup) and create a repository.

First, we need to create SSH keys to save to BitBucket for
authentication. You can skip the second line if you already created SSH
keys.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo su
ssh-keygen -t rsa
# Copy this output to BitBucket as a new SSH key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to install git, and create a folder to save all our
configurations in. We'll do this by symlinking the files we're using to
a folder as root.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install git-core
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git init
# Create an account and repository at BitBucket, sub in your own username/repo name
git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/USERNAME/REPO.git
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have the repository set up, let's add our first file. I'm
going to add my NFS exports file. You'll need to do this for each file.
You can commit separately, or symlink all the files then do the commits
at the end.

{% highlight bash %}
# Repository is set up. Now let's add some stuff and commit it.
mkdir ~/git/etc
# Symlink
ln -s /etc/exports etc/exports
# Add everything
git add -A
# Commit with a commit message
git commit -am "Adding NFS exports"
# Push the master branch to the origin server (BitBucket)
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, to help myself remember to commit, I am adding a reminder to my
bashrc. Every time I log in as root, I will receive a message if there
are uncommited files my git directory.

{% highlight bash %}
nano ~/.bashrc
-----
# Add this to the end of the file
# Check git status
cd /root/git
DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null\grep "^??" \wc -l)
if [ $DIRTY != 0 ]; then
    echo -e '\E[47;31m'"\033[1mGit changes in /root/git need to be commited.\033[0m"
fi
{% endhighlight %}
