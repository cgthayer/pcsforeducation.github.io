Most packages that arenâ€™t gotten through the default package manager are
compiled for a single architecture (x86, amd64, ARM, etc), therefore it
is useful to have a quick way to check whether the system is 32 or 64
bit, so an if statement can be used to do the appropriate action.

{% highlight bash %}
#uname prints system info, like kernel, processor, etc. uname -m prints hardware name
if [ $(uname -m) == "amd64" ]; then
    ARCH=64
else
    ARCH=32
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can access \$ARCH anywhere else in your program like so:

{% highlight bash %}
if [ $ARCH == "32" ]; then
    #Download 32 bit package
else
    #Download 64 bit package
fi
{% endhighlight %}
